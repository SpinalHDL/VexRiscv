Description
-----------

This repository hosts a RISC-V implementation written in SpinalHDL. Here are some specs :


* RV32I[M][C] instruction set
* Pipelined with 5 stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, WriteBack)
* 1.44 DMIPS/Mhz --no-inline when nearly all features are enabled (1.57 DMIPS/Mhz when the divider lookup table is enabled)
* Optimized for FPGA, fully portable
* AXI4 and Avalon ready
* Optional MUL/DIV extensions
* Optional instruction and data caches
* Optional MMU
* Optional debug extension allowing Eclipse debugging via a GDB >> openOCD >> JTAG connection
* Optional interrupts and exception handling with Machine and User modes as defined in the `RISC-V Privileged ISA Specification v1.9 <https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/>`_.
* Two implementations of shift instructions: Single cycle and shiftNumber cycles
* Each stage can have optional bypass or interlock hazard logic
* Zephyr RISC-V port compatible
* `FreeRTOS port <https://github.com/Dolu1990/FreeRTOS-RISCV>`_
* The data cache supports atomic LR/SC
* Optional RV32 compressed instruction support in the reworkFetch branch for configurations without instruction cache (will be merge in master, WIP)

The hardware description of this CPU is done by using a very software oriented approach
(without any overhead in the generated hardware). Here is a list of software concepts used:


* There are very few fixed things. Nearly everything is plugin based. The PC manager is a plugin, the register file is a plugin, the hazard controller is a plugin, ...
* There is an automatic a tool which allows plugins to insert data in the pipeline at a given stage, and allows other plugins to read it in another stage through automatic pipelining.
* There is a service system which provides a very dynamic framework. For instance, a plugin could provide an exception service which can then be used by other plugins to emit exceptions from the pipeline.

Area usage and maximal frequency
--------------------------------

The following numbers were obtained by synthesizing the CPU as toplevel without any specific synthesis options to save area or to get better maximal frequency (neutral).\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
The clock constraint is set to an unattainable value, which tends to increase the design area.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
The dhrystone benchmark was compiled with the ``-O3 -fno-inline`` option.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
All the cached configurations have some cache trashing during the dhrystone benchmark except the ``VexRiscv full max perf`` one. This of course reduces the performance. It is possible to produce
dhrystone binaries which fit inside a 4KB I$ and 4KB D$ (I already had this case once) but currently it isn't the case.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
The CPU configurations used below can be found in the ``src/scala/vexriscv/demo`` directory.

     Cyclone V  -> 108 Mhz 1,430 ALMs
     Cyclone IV -> 100 Mhz 2,976 LUT 2,201 FF

The following configuration results in 1.44 DMIPS/MHz:


* 5 stage : F -> D -> E -> M  -> WB
* single cycle ADD/SUB/Bitwise/Shift ALU
* branch/jump done in the E stage
* memory load values are bypassed in the WB stage (late result)
* 33 cycle division with bypassing in the M stage (late result)
* single cycle multiplication with bypassing in the WB stage (late result)
* dynamic branch prediction done in the F stage with a direct mapped target buffer cache (no penalties on correct predictions)

Note that recently, the capability to remove the Fetch/Memory/WriteBack stage was added to reduce the area of the CPU, which end up with a smaller CPU and a better DMIPS/Mhz for the small configurations.

Dependencies
------------

On Ubuntu 14 :

.. code-block:: sh

   # JAVA JDK 8. Do not try with JDK >= 9
   sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk -y
   sudo update-alternatives --config java
   sudo update-alternatives --config javac

   # Install SBT - https://www.scala-sbt.org/

   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install sbt

   # Verilator (for sim only, realy need 3.9+, in general apt-get will give you 3.8)
   sudo apt-get install git make autoconf g++ flex bison
   git clone http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator   # Only first time
   unsetenv VERILATOR_ROOT  # For csh; ignore error if on bash
   unset VERILATOR_ROOT  # For bash
   cd verilator
   git pull        # Make sure we're up-to-date
   git checkout verilator_3_918
   autoconf        # Create ./configure script
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

CPU generation
--------------

You can find two example CPU instances in:


* src/main/scala/vexriscv/GenFull.scala
* src/main/scala/vexriscv/GenSmallest.scala

To generate the corresponding RTL as a VexRiscv.v file, run the following commands in the root directory of this repository:

.. code-block:: sh

   sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.GenFull"

or

.. code-block:: sh

   sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.GenSmallest"

NOTES:


* It could take time the first time you run it.
* The VexRiscv project may need an unreleased master-head of the SpinalHDL repo. If it fails to compile, just get the SpinalHDL repository and
   do a "sbt clean compile publish-local" in it as described in the dependencies chapter.

Regression tests
----------------

To run tests (need the verilator simulator), go in the src/test/cpp/regression folder and run :

.. code-block:: sh

   # To test the GenFull CPU
   # (Don't worry about the CSR test not passing, basicaly the GenFull isn't the truly full version of the CPU, some CSR features are disable in it)
   make clean run

   # To test the GenSmallest CPU
   make clean run IBUS=SIMPLE DBUS=SIMPLE CSR=no MMU=no DEBUG_PLUGIN=no MUL=no DIV=no

The self-test includes:


* ISA tests from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests/tree/master/isa
* Dhrystone benchmark
* 24 FreeRTOS tests
* Some handwritten tests to check the CSR, debug module and MMU plugins

You can enable FreeRTOS tests by adding ``FREERTOS=yes`` to the command line, but it will take time to run. Also, it uses THREAD_COUNT host CPU threads to run multiple regression in parallel.

Interactive debug of the simulated CPU via GDB OpenOCD and Verilator
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It's as described to run tests, but you just have to add ``DEBUG_PLUGIN_EXTERNAL=yes`` in the make arguments.
Work for the GenFull, but not for the GenSmallest as this configuration has no debug module.

Then you can use the https://github.com/SpinalHDL/openocd_riscv tool to create a GDB server connected to the target (the simulated CPU)

.. code-block:: sh

   #in the VexRiscv repository, to run the simulation on which one OpenOCD can connect itself =>
   sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.GenFull"
   cd src/test/cpp/regression
   make run DEBUG_PLUGIN_EXTERNAL=yes

   #In the openocd git, after building it =>
   src/openocd -c "set VEXRISCV_YAML PATH_TO_THE_GENERATED_CPU0_YAML_FILE" -f tcl/target/vexriscv_sim.cfg

   #Run a GDB session with an elf RISCV executable (GenFull CPU)
   YourRiscvToolsPath/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb VexRiscvRepo/src/test/resources/elf/uart.elf
   target remote localhost:3333
   monitor reset halt
   load
   continue

   # Now it should print messages in the Verilator simulation of the CPU

Using Eclipse to run the software and debug it
----------------------------------------------

By using Zylin plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the Eclipse + Zylin embedded CDT plugin to do it (http://opensource.zylin.com/embeddedcdt.html). Tested with Helios Service Release 2 (http://www.Eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/helios/SR2/Eclipse-cpp-helios-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz) and the corresponding zylin plugin.

To following commands will download Eclipse and install the plugin.

.. code-block:: sh

   wget http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/helios/SR2/eclipse-cpp-helios-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf download.php?file=%2Ftechnology%2Fepp%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Fhelios%2FSR2%2Feclipse-cpp-helios-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
   cd eclipse
   ./eclipse -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -repository http://opensource.zylin.com/zylincdt -installIU com.zylin.cdt.feature.feature.group/

See https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NseNHH05B6lmIXqQFVwK8xRjWE4ydeG-?usp=sharing to import a makefile project and create a debug configuration.

Note that sometime this Eclipse need to be restarted in order to be able to place new breakpoints.

By using FreedomStudio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can get FreedomStudio (which is package with Eclipse and some plugins) here: https://www.sifive.com/products/tools/

See https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a7FyMOYgFc9UDhfsWUSCjyqDCvOrts2J?usp=sharing to import a makefile project and create a debug configuration.

Briey SoC
---------

As a demonstrator, a SoC named Briey is implemented in ``src/main/scala/vexriscv/demo/Briey.scala``. This SoC is very similar to
the `Pinsec SOC <https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc/spinal/lib/pinsec/hardware/>`_\ :


.. image:: /assets/brieySoc.png
   :target: /assets/brieySoc.png
   :alt: Alt text


To generate the Briey SoC Hardware:

.. code-block:: sh

   sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.Briey"

To run the verilator simulation of the Briey SoC which can then be connected to OpenOCD/GDB, first get those dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get install build-essential xorg-dev libudev-dev libts-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libopenal-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libaudiofile-dev libpng12-dev libfreetype6-dev libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev zlib1g-dev libdirectfb-dev libsdl2-dev

Then go in ``src/test/cpp/briey`` and run the simulation with (UART TX is printed in the terminal, VGA is displayed in a GUI):

.. code-block:: sh

   make clean run

To connect OpenOCD (https://github.com/SpinalHDL/openocd_riscv) to the simulation :

.. code-block:: sh

   src/openocd -f tcl/interface/jtag_tcp.cfg -c "set BRIEY_CPU0_YAML /home/spinalvm/Spinal/VexRiscv/cpu0.yaml" -f tcl/target/briey.cfg

You can find multiple software examples and demos here: https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscvSocSoftware/tree/master/projects/briey

You can find some FPGA projects which instantiate the Briey SoC here (DE1-SoC, DE0-Nano): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-CqLXDTaMbKZGdJZlZ5THAxRTQ?usp=sharing

Here are some measurements of Briey SoC timings and area :

.. code-block:: text

     Artix 7    -> 239 Mhz 3227 LUT 3410 FF
     Cyclone V  -> 125 Mhz 2,207 ALMs
     Cyclone IV -> 112 Mhz 4,594 LUT 3,620

Murax SoC
---------

Murax is a very light SoC (it fits in an ICE40 FPGA) which can work without any external components:


* VexRiscv RV32I[M]
* JTAG debugger (Eclipse/GDB/openocd ready)
* 8 kB of on-chip ram
* Interrupt support
* APB bus for peripherals
* 32 GPIO pin
* one 16 bits prescaler, two 16 bits timers
* one UART with tx/rx fifo

Depending the CPU configuration, on the ICE40-hx8k FPGA with icestorm for synthesis, the full SoC has the following area/performance :


* RV32I interlocked stages => 51 Mhz, 2387 LC 0.45 DMIPS/Mhz
* RV32I bypassed stages    => 45 Mhz, 2718 LC 0.65 DMIPS/Mhz

Its implementation can be found here: ``src/main/scala/vexriscv/demo/Murax.scala``.

To generate the Murax SoC Hardware :

.. code-block:: sh

   # To generate the SoC without any content in the ram
   sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.Murax"

   # To generate the SoC with a demo program already in ram
   sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.MuraxWithRamInit"

The demo program included by default with ``MuraxWithRamInit`` will blink the
LEDs and echo characters received on the UART back to the user. To see this
when running the Verilator sim, type some text and press enter.

Then go in src/test/cpp/murax and run the simulation with :

.. code-block:: sh

   make clean run

To connect OpenOCD (https://github.com/SpinalHDL/openocd_riscv) to the simulation :

.. code-block:: sh

   src/openocd -f tcl/interface/jtag_tcp.cfg -c "set MURAX_CPU0_YAML /home/spinalvm/Spinal/VexRiscv/cpu0.yaml" -f tcl/target/murax.cfg

You can find multiple software examples and demos here: https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscvSocSoftware/tree/master/projects/murax

Here are some timing and area measurements of the Murax SoC:

.. code-block:: text

   Murax interlocked stages (0.45 DMIPS/Mhz, 8 bits GPIO) ->
     Artix 7    -> 299 Mhz 984 LUT 1186 FF 
     Cyclone V  -> 175 Mhz 710 ALMs
     Cyclone IV -> 137 Mhz 1,436 LUT 1,193 FF 
     iCE40      -> 48 Mhz 2337 LC (icestorm)
     iCE40Ultra -> 20 Mhz 2337 LC (icestorm)

   MuraxFast bypassed stages (0.65 DMIPS/Mhz, 8 bits GPIO) ->
     Artix 7    -> 294 Mhz 1128 LUT 1219 FF 
     Cyclone V  -> 165 Mhz 840 ALMs
     Cyclone IV -> 141 Mhz 1,680 LUT 1,227 FF 
     iCE40      -> 48 Mhz 2702 LC (icestorm)
     iCE40Ultra -> 22 Mhz 2702 LC (icestorm)

Some scripts to generate the SoC and call the icestorm toolchain can be found here: ``scripts/Murax/``

A toplevel simulation testbench with the same features + a GUI are implemented with SpinalSim. You can find it in ``src/test/scala/vexriscv/MuraxSim.scala``.

To run it :

.. code-block:: sh

   # This will generate the Murax RTL + run its testbench. You need Verilator 3.9xx installated.
   sbt "test:runMain vexriscv.MuraxSim"

Build the RISC-V GCC
--------------------

A prebuild GCC toolsuite can be found here:


* https://www.sifive.com/products/tools/  => SiFive GNU Embedded Toolchain

The VexRiscvSocSoftware makefiles are expecting to find this prebuild version in /opt/riscv/\ **contentOfThisPreBuild**

.. code-block:: sh

   wget https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6.tar.gz
   sudo mv riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6 /opt/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6
   sudo mv /opt/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-20171231-x86_64-linux-centos6 /opt/riscv
   echo 'export PATH=/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

If you want to compile the rv32i and rv32im GCC toolchain from source code and install them in ``/opt/``\ , do the following (will take one hour):

.. code-block:: sh

   # Be carefull, sometime the git clone has issue to successfully clone riscv-gnu-toolchain.
   sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev -y

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain riscv-gnu-toolchain
   cd riscv-gnu-toolchain

   echo "Starting RISC-V Toolchain build process"

   ARCH=rv32im
   rmdir -rf $ARCH
   mkdir $ARCH; cd $ARCH
   ../configure  --prefix=/opt/$ARCH --with-arch=$ARCH --with-abi=ilp32
   sudo make -j4
   cd ..


   ARCH=rv32i
   rmdir -rf $ARCH
   mkdir $ARCH; cd $ARCH
   ../configure  --prefix=/opt/$ARCH --with-arch=$ARCH --with-abi=ilp32
   sudo make -j4
   cd ..

   echo -e "\\nRISC-V Toolchain installation completed!"

CPU parametrization and instantiation example
---------------------------------------------

You can find many examples of different configurations in the https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv/tree/master/src/main/scala/vexriscv/demo folder.

Here is one such example:

.. code-block:: scala

   import vexriscv._
   import vexriscv.plugin._

   //Instanciate one VexRiscv
   val cpu = new VexRiscv(
     //Provide a configuration instance
     config = VexRiscvConfig(
       //Provide a list of plugins which will futher add their logic into the CPU
       plugins = List(
         new IBusSimplePlugin(
           resetVector = 0x00000000l,
           cmdForkOnSecondStage = true,
           cmdForkPersistence  = true
         ),
         new DBusSimplePlugin(
           catchAddressMisaligned = false,
           catchAccessFault = false
         ),
         new DecoderSimplePlugin(
           catchIllegalInstruction = false
         ),
         new RegFilePlugin(
           regFileReadyKind = Plugin.SYNC,
           zeroBoot = true
         ),
         new IntAluPlugin,
         new SrcPlugin(
           separatedAddSub = false,
           executeInsertion = false
         ),
         new LightShifterPlugin,
         new HazardSimplePlugin(
           bypassExecute           = false,
           bypassMemory            = false,
           bypassWriteBack         = false,
           bypassWriteBackBuffer   = false
         ),
         new BranchPlugin(
           earlyBranch = false,
           catchAddressMisaligned = false
         ),
         new YamlPlugin("cpu0.yaml")
       )
     )
   )

Add a custom instruction to the CPU via the plugin system
---------------------------------------------------------

Here is an example of a simple plugin which adds a simple SIMD_ADD instruction:

.. code-block:: scala

   import spinal.core._
   import vexriscv.plugin.Plugin
   import vexriscv.{Stageable, DecoderService, VexRiscv}

   //This plugin example will add a new instruction named SIMD_ADD which do the following :
   //
   //RD : Regfile Destination, RS : Regfile Source
   //RD( 7 downto  0) = RS1( 7 downto  0) + RS2( 7 downto  0)
   //RD(16 downto  8) = RS1(16 downto  8) + RS2(16 downto  8)
   //RD(23 downto 16) = RS1(23 downto 16) + RS2(23 downto 16)
   //RD(31 downto 24) = RS1(31 downto 24) + RS2(31 downto 24)
   //
   //Instruction encoding :
   //0000011----------000-----0110011
   //       |RS2||RS1|   |RD |
   //
   //Note :  RS1, RS2, RD positions follow the RISC-V spec and are common for all instruction of the ISA

   class SimdAddPlugin extends Plugin[VexRiscv]{
     //Define the concept of IS_SIMD_ADD signals, which specify if the current instruction is destined for ths plugin
     object IS_SIMD_ADD extends Stageable(Bool)

     //Callback to setup the plugin and ask for different services
     override def setup(pipeline: VexRiscv): Unit = {
       import pipeline.config._

       //Retrieve the DecoderService instance
       val decoderService = pipeline.service(classOf[DecoderService])

       //Specify the IS_SIMD_ADD default value when instruction are decoded
       decoderService.addDefault(IS_SIMD_ADD, False)

       //Specify the instruction decoding which should be applied when the instruction match the 'key' parttern
       decoderService.add(

         List(

           RS1_USE                  -> True, //Notify the hazard management unit that this instruction use the RS1 value
           RS2_USE                  -> True  //Same than above but for RS2.
         )
       )
     }

     override def build(pipeline: VexRiscv): Unit = {
       import pipeline._
       import pipeline.config._

       //Add a new scope on the execute stage (used to give a name to signals)
       execute plug new Area {
         //Define some signals used internally to the plugin
         val rs1 = execute.input(RS1).asUInt
         //32 bits UInt value of the regfile[RS1]
         val rs2 = execute.input(RS2).asUInt
         val rd = UInt(32 bits)

         //Do some computation
         rd(7 downto 0) := rs1(7 downto 0) + rs2(7 downto 0)
         rd(16 downto 8) := rs1(16 downto 8) + rs2(16 downto 8)
         rd(23 downto 16) := rs1(23 downto 16) + rs2(23 downto 16)
         rd(31 downto 24) := rs1(31 downto 24) + rs2(31 downto 24)

         //When the instruction is a SIMD_ADD one, then write the result into the register file data path.
         when(execute.input(IS_SIMD_ADD)) {
           execute.output(REGFILE_WRITE_DATA) := rd.asBits
         }
       }
     }
   }

If you want to add this plugin to a given CPU, you just need to add it to its parameterized plugin list.

This example is a very simple one, but each plugin can really have access to the whole CPU:


* Halt a given stage of the CPU
* Unschedule instructions
* Emit an exception
* Introduce new instruction decoding specification
* Ask to jump the PC somewhere
* Read signals published by other plugins
* override published signals values
* Provide an alternative implementation
* ...

As a demonstrator, this SimdAddPlugin was integrated in the ``src/main/scala/vexriscv/demo/GenCustomSimdAdd.scala`` CPU configuration
and is self-tested by the ``src/test/cpp/custom/simd_add`` application by running the following commands :

.. code-block:: sh

   # Generate the CPU
   sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.GenCustomSimdAdd"

   cd src/test/cpp/regression/

   # Optionally add TRACE=yes if you want to get the VCD waveform from the simulation.
   # Also you have to know that by default, the testbench introduce instruction/data bus stall.
   # Note the CUSTOM_SIMD_ADD flag is set to yes.
   make clean run IBUS=SIMPLE DBUS=SIMPLE CSR=no MMU=no DEBUG_PLUGIN=no MUL=no DIV=no DHRYSTONE=no REDO=2 CUSTOM_SIMD_ADD=yes

To retrieve the plugin related signals in your waveform viewer, just filter with ``simd``.

Adding a new CSR via the plugin system
--------------------------------------

Here are two examples about how to add a custom CSR to the CPU via the plugin system:
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv/blob/master/src/main/scala/vexriscv/demo/CustomCsrDemoPlugin.scala

The first one (\ ``CustomCsrDemoPlugin``\ ) adds an instruction counter and a clock cycle counter into the CSR mapping (and also do tricky stuff as a demonstration).

The second one (\ ``CustomCsrDemoGpioPlugin``\ ) creates a GPIO peripheral directly mapped into the CSR.

CPU clock and resets
--------------------

Without the debug plugin, the CPU will have a standard ``clk`` input and a ``reset`` input. But with the debug plugin the situation is the following :


* clk : As before, the clock which drive the whole CPU design, including the debug logic
* reset : Reset all the CPU states excepted the debug logics
* debugReset : Reset the debug logic of the CPU
* debug_resetOut : a CPU output signal which allows the JTAG to reset the CPU + the memory interconnect + the peripherals

So here is the reset interconnect in case you use the debug plugin :

.. code-block:: text

VexRiscv Architecture
---------------------

VexRiscv is implemented via a 5 stage in-order pipeline on which many optional and complementary plugins add functionalities to provide a functional RISC-V CPU.
This approach is completely unconventional and only possible through meta hardware description languages (SpinalHDL in the current case) but has proven its advantages
via the VexRiscv implementation:


* You can swap/turn on/turn off parts of the CPU directly via the plugin system
* You can add new functionalities/instruction without having to modify any sources code of the CPU
* It allows the CPU configuration to cover a very large spectrum of implementation without cooking spaghetti code
* It allows your code base to truly produce a parametrized CPU design

If you generate the CPU without any plugin, it will only contain the definition of the 5 pipeline stages and their basic arbitration, but nothing else,
as everything else, including the program counter is added into the CPU via plugins.

IBusSimplePlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin implement the CPU frontend (instruction fetch) via a very simple and neutral memory interface going outside the CPU.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - catchAccessFault
     - Boolean
     - If an the read response specify an read error and this parameter is true, it will generate an CPU exception trap
   * - resetVector
     - BigInt
     - Address of the program counter after the reset
   * - cmdForkOnSecondStage
     - Boolean
     - By default jump have an asynchronous immediate effect on the program counter, which allow to reduce the branch penalties by one cycle but could reduce the FMax as it will combinatorialy drive the instruction bus address signal. To avoid this you can set this parameter to true, which will make the jump affecting the programm counter in a sequancial way, which will cut the combinatorial path but add one additional cycle of penalty when a jump occur.
   * - cmdForkPersistence
     - Boolean
     - If this parameter is false, then request on the iBus can disappear/change before their completion. Which reduce area but isn't safe/supported by many arbitration/slaves. If you set this parameter to true, then the iBus cmd will stay until they are completed.
   * - compressedGen
     - Boolean
     - Enable RVC support
   * - busLatencyMin
     - Int
     - Specify the minimal latency between the iBus.cmd and iBus.rsp, which will add the corresponding number of stages into the frontend to keep the IPC to 1.
   * - injectorStage
     - Boolean
     - Add a stage between the frontend and the decode stage of the CPU to improve FMax. (busLatencyMin + injectorStage) should be at least two.
   * - prediction
     - BranchPrediction
     - Can be set to NONE/STATIC/DYNAMIC/DYNAMIC_TARGET to specify the branch predictor implementation, see bellow for more descriptions
   * - historyRamSizeLog2
     - Int
     - Specify the number of entries in the direct mapped prediction cache of DYNAMIC/DYNAMIC_TARGET implementation. 2 pow historyRamSizeLog2 entries


Here is the SimpleBus interface definition

.. code-block:: scala

   case class IBusSimpleCmd() extends Bundle{
     val pc = UInt(32 bits)
   }

   case class IBusSimpleRsp() extends Bundle with IMasterSlave{
     val error = Bool
     val inst  = Bits(32 bits)

     override def asMaster(): Unit = {
       out(error,inst)
     }
   }

   case class IBusSimpleBus(interfaceKeepData : Boolean) extends Bundle with IMasterSlave{
     var cmd = Stream(IBusSimpleCmd())
     var rsp = Flow(IBusSimpleRsp())

     override def asMaster(): Unit = {
       master(cmd)
       slave(rsp)
     }
   }

**Important** : Checkout the cmdForkPersistence parameter, because if it's not set, it can break the iBus compatibility with your memory system (unless you externaly add some buffers)

Setting cmdForkPersistence and cmdForkOnSecondStage improves iBus cmd timings.

Note that bridges are implemented to convert this interface into AXI4 and Avalon

The jump interface implemented by this plugin allow all other plugin to request jumps. The stage argument specify from which stage the jump is asked, which will allow the PcManagerSimplePlugin plugin to manage priorities between jump requests.

.. code-block:: scala

   trait JumpService{
     def createJumpInterface(stage : Stage) : Flow[UInt]
   }

Note: If you enable the twoCycleRam option and if wayCount is bigger than one, then the register file plugin should be configured to read the regFile in a asynchronous manner.

DecoderSimplePlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin provides instruction decoding capabilities to others plugins.

For instance, for a given instruction, the pipeline hazard plugin needs to know if it uses the register file source 1/2 in order stall the pipeline until the hazard is gone.
To provide this kind of information, each plugin which implements an instruction documents this kind of information to the DecoderSimplePlugin plugin.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - catchIllegalInstruction
     - Boolean
     - If set to true, instruction which have no decoding specification will generate a trap exception


Here is a usage example :

.. code-block:: scala

       //Specify the instruction decoding which should be applied when the instruction match the 'key' pattern
       decoderService.add(
         //Bit pattern of the new instruction
         key = M"0000011----------000-----0110011",

         //Decoding specification when the 'key' pattern is recognized in the instruction
         List(
           IS_SIMD_ADD              -> True,
           REGFILE_WRITE_VALID      -> True, //Enable the register file write
           BYPASSABLE_EXECUTE_STAGE -> True, //Notify the hazard management unit that the instruction result is already accessible in the EXECUTE stage (Bypass ready)
           BYPASSABLE_MEMORY_STAGE  -> True, //Same as above but for the memory stage
           RS1_USE                  -> True, //Notify the hazard management unit that this instruction use the RS1 value
           RS2_USE                  -> True  //Same than above but for RS2.
         )
       )
     }

This plugin operates in the Decode stage.

RegFilePlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin implements the register file.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - regFileReadyKind
     - RegFileReadKind
     - Can bet set to ASYNC or SYNC. Specifies the kind of memory read used to implement the register file. ASYNC means zero cycle latency memory read, while SYNC means one cycle latency memory read which can be mapped into standard FPGA memory blocks
   * - zeroBoot
     - Boolean
     - Load all registers with zeroes at the beginning of simulations to keep everything deterministic in logs/traces


This register file use a ``don't care`` read-during-write policy, so the bypassing/hazard plugin should take care of this.

HazardSimplePlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin checks the pipeline instruction dependencies and, if necessary or possible, will stop the instruction in the decoding stage or bypass the instruction results
from the later stages to the decode stage.

Since the register file is implemented with a ``don't care`` read-during-write policy, this plugin also manages these kind of hazards.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - bypassExecute
     - Boolean
     - Enable the bypassing of instruction results coming from the Execute stage
   * - bypassMemory
     - Boolean
     - Enable the bypassing of instruction results coming from the Memory stage
   * - bypassWriteBack
     - Boolean
     - Enable the bypassing of instruction results coming from the WriteBack stage
   * - bypassWriteBackBuffer
     - Boolean
     - Enable the bypassing of the previous cycle register file written value


SrcPlugin
~~~~~~~~~

This plugin muxes different input values to produce SRC1/SRC2/SRC_ADD/SRC_SUB/SRC_LESS values which are common values used by many plugins in the execute stage (ALU/Branch/Load/Store).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - separatedAddSub
     - RegFileReadKind
     - By default SRC_ADD/SRC_SUB are generated from a single controllable adder/substractor, but if this is set to true, it use separate adder/substractors
   * - executeInsertion
     - Boolean
     - By default SRC1/SRC2 are generated in the Decode stage, but if this parameter is true, it is done in the Execute stage (It will relax the bypassing network)


Except for SRC1/SRC2, this plugin does everything at the begining of Execute stage.

IntAluPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin implements all ADD/SUB/SLT/SLTU/XOR/OR/AND/LUI/AUIPC instructions in the execute stage by using the SrcPlugin outputs. It is a realy simple plugin.

The result is injected into the pipeline directly at the end of the execute stage.

LightShifterPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implements SLL/SRL/SRA instructions by using an iterative shifter register, while using one cycle per bit shift.

The result is injected into the pipeline directly at the end of the execute stage.

FullBarrelShifterPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implements SLL/SRL/SRA instructions by using a full barrel shifter, so it execute all shifts in a single cycle.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - earlyInjection
     - Boolean
     - By default the result of the shift is injected into the pipeline in the Memory stage to relax timings, but if this option is true it will be done in the Execute stage


BranchPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin implement all branch/jump instructions (JAL/JALR/BEQ/BNE/BLT/BGE/BLTU/BGEU) with primitives used by the cpu frontend plugins to implement branch prediction. The prediction implementation is set in the frontend plugins (IBusX)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - earlyBranch
     - Boolean
     - By default the branch is done in the Memory stage to relax timings, but if this option is set it's done in the Execute stage
   * - catchAddressMisaligned
     - Boolean
     - If a jump/branch is done in an unaligned PC address, it will fire an trap exception


Each miss predicted jumps will produce between 2 and 4 cycles penalty depending the ``earlyBranch`` and the ``PcManagerSimplePlugin.relaxedPcCalculation`` configurations

Prediction NONE
"""""""""""""""

No prediction: each PC change due to a jump/branch will produce a penalty.

Prediction STATIC
"""""""""""""""""

In the decode stage, a conditional branch pointing backwards or a JAL is branched speculatively. If the speculation is right, the branch penalty is reduced to a single cycle,
otherwise the standard penalty is applied.

Prediction DYNAMIC
""""""""""""""""""

Same as the STATIC prediction, except that to do the prediction, it use a direct mapped 2 bit history cache (BHT) which remembers if the branch is more likely to be taken or not.

Prediction DYNAMIC_TARGET
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

This predictor uses a direct mapped branch target buffer (BTB) in the Fetch stage which store the PC of the instruction, the target PC of the instruction and a 2 bit history to remember
if the branch is more likely to be taken or not. This is the most efficient branch predictor actualy implemented on VexRiscv as when the branch prediction is right, it produce no branch penalty.
The down side is that this predictor has a long combinatorial path coming from the prediction cache read port to the programm counter by passing through the jump interface.

DBusSimplePlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin implements the load and store instructions (LB/LH/LW/LBU/LHU/LWU/SB/SH/SW) via a simple and neutral memory bus going out of the CPU.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - catchAddressMisaligned
     - Boolean
     - If a memory access is done to an unaligned memory address, it will fire a trap exception
   * - catchAccessFault
     - Boolean
     - If a memory read returns an error, it will fire a trap exception
   * - earlyInjection
     - Boolean
     - By default, the memory read values are injected into the pipeline in the WriteBack stage to relax the timings. If this parameter is true, it's done in the Memory stage


Here is the DBusSimpleBus

.. code-block:: scala

   case class DBusSimpleCmd() extends Bundle{
     val wr = Bool
     val address = UInt(32 bits)
     val data = Bits(32 bit)
     val size = UInt(2 bit)
   }

   case class DBusSimpleRsp() extends Bundle with IMasterSlave{
     val ready = Bool
     val error = Bool
     val data = Bits(32 bit)

     override def asMaster(): Unit = {
       out(ready,error,data)
     }
   }


   case class DBusSimpleBus() extends Bundle with IMasterSlave{
     val cmd = Stream(DBusSimpleCmd())
     val rsp = DBusSimpleRsp()

     override def asMaster(): Unit = {
       master(cmd)
       slave(rsp)
     }
   }

Note that bridges are available to convert this interface into AXI4 and Avalon

There is at least one cycle latency between a cmd and the corresponding rsp. The rsp.ready flag should be false after a read cmd until the rsp is present.

DBusCachedPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Single way cache implementation with a victim buffer. (Documentation is WIP)

MulPlugin
~~~~~~~~~

Implements the multiplication instruction from the RISC-V M extension. Its implementation was done in a FPGA friendly way by using 4 17*17 bit multiplications.
The processing is fully pipelined between the Execute/Memory/Writeback stage. The results of the instructions are always inserted in the WriteBack stage.

DivPlugin
~~~~~~~~~

Implements the division/modulo instruction from the RISC-V M extension. It is done in a simple iterative way which always takes 34 cycles. The result is inserted into the
Memory stage.

This plugin is now based on the MulDivIterativePlugin one.

MulDivIterativePlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin implements the multiplication, division and modulo of the RISC-V M extension in an iterative way, which is friendly for small FPGAs that don't have DSP blocks.

This plugin is able to unroll the iterative calculation process to reduce the number of cycles used to execute mul/div instructions.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - genMul
     - Boolean
     - Enables multiplication support. Can be set to false if you want to use the MulPlugin instead
   * - genDiv
     - Boolean
     - Enables division support
   * - mulUnrollFactor
     - Int
     - Number of combinatorial stages used to speed up the multiplication, should be > 0
   * - divUnrollFactor
     - Int
     - Number of combinatorial stages used to speed up the division, should be > 0


The number of cycles used to execute a multiplication is '32/mulUnrollFactor'
The number of cycles used to execute a division is '32/divUnrollFactor + 1'

Both mul/div are processed into the memory stage (late result).

CsrPlugin
~~~~~~~~~

Implements most of the Machine mode and a few of the User mode registers as specified in the RISC-V priviledged spec.
The access mode of most of the CSR is parameterizable (NONE/READ_ONLY/WRITE_ONLY/READ_WRITE) to reduce the area usage of unneeded features.

(CsrAccess can be NONE/READ_ONLY/WRITE_ONLY/READ_WRITE)

If an interrupt occurs, before jumping to mtvec, the plugin will stop the Prefetch stage and wait for all the instructions in the later pipeline stages to complete their execution.

If an exception occur, the plugin will kill the corresponding instruction, flush all previous instructions, and wait until the previously killed instructions reach the WriteBack
stage before jumping to mtvec.

StaticMemoryTranslatorPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Static memory translator plugin which allows one to specify which range of the memory addresses is IO mapped and shouldn't be cached.

MemoryTranslatorPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple software refilled MMU implementation. Allows others plugins such as DBusCachedPlugin/IBusCachedPlugin to instanciate memory address translation ports. Each port has a small dedicated
fully associative TLB cache which is refilled from a larger software filled TLB cache via a query which looks up one entry per cycle.

DebugPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin implements enough CPU debug features to allow comfortable GDB/Eclipse debugging. To access those debug features, it provides a simple memory bus interface.
The JTAG interface is provided by another bridge, which makes it possible to efficiently connect multiple CPUs to the same JTAG.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameters
     - type
     - description
   * - debugClockDomain
     - ClockDomain
     - As the debug unit is able to reset the CPU itself, it should use another clock domain to avoid killing itself (only the reset wire should differ)


The internals of the debug plugin are done in a manner which reduces the area usage and the FMax impact of this plugin.

Here is the simple bus to access it, the rsp come one cycle after the request :

.. code-block:: scala

   case class DebugExtensionCmd() extends Bundle{
     val wr = Bool
     val address = UInt(8 bit)
     val data = Bits(32 bit)
   }
   case class DebugExtensionRsp() extends Bundle{
     val data = Bits(32 bit)
   }

   case class DebugExtensionBus() extends Bundle with IMasterSlave{
     val cmd = Stream(DebugExtensionCmd())
     val rsp = DebugExtensionRsp()

     override def asMaster(): Unit = {
       master(cmd)
       in(rsp)
     }
   }

Here is the register mapping :

.. code-block:: text

   Read address 0x00 ->
     bit 0  : resetIt
     bit 1  : haltIt
     bit 2  : isPipBusy
     bit 3  : haltedByBreak
     bit 4  : stepIt
   Write address 0x00 ->
     bit 4  : stepIt
     bit 16 : set resetIt
     bit 17 : set haltIt
     bit 24 : clear resetIt
     bit 25 : clear haltIt and haltedByBreak

   Read Address 0x04 ->
     bits (31 downto 0) : Last value written into the register file
   Write Address 0x04 ->
     bits (31 downto 0) : Instruction that should be pushed into the CPU pipeline for debug purposes

The OpenOCD port is there :

YamlPlugin
~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin offers a service to others plugins to generate a usefull Yaml file about the CPU configuration. It contains, for instance, the sequence of instruction required
to flush the data cache (information used by openocd).
